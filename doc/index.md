# JSTP / JavaScript Transfer Protocol

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/metarhia/JSTP.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/metarhia/JSTP)

[![DevDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/metarhia/JSTP/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/metarhia/JSTP)

## Installation

JSTP works in Node.js and web browsers. To install it, simply run:

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev metarhia-jstp
```

Then

```javascript
const jstp = require('metarhia-jstp');
```

in your code.

Or, alternatively, if you are developing a client-side application for browser
environment and don't use a module bundler like Webpack, you can grab
[jstp.min.js](https://metarhia.github.io/JSTP/dist/jstp.min.js) and
[jstp.min.js.map](https://metarhia.github.io/JSTP/dist/jstp.min.js.map).
JSTP will be available globally as `api.jstp`.

## Concept

JSTP is a family of data formats and corresponding libraries for their
processing that are based on some simple assumptions:

* it is possible to trasfer data as plain JavaScript code easier and
  more efficient than using JSON:
    - in its simplest implementation it doesn't even require a specialized
      parser since it is already built into transferer and receiver systems;
    - a human-readable format can be almost as minimalist as a binary one,
      losing coding efficiency very slightly yet winning from the simplicity
      of packet inspection;
    - serialization format and data modeling must be maximally univocal and
      must answer a question about why someone has done something this way;
    - there should be possibility to apply different formatting and use
      comments;

* it is redundant to send a structure along with data each time, the
  serialization format and the protocol must be optimized to exempt
  metamodel and send it only when the receiver hasn't got it yet;

* the protocol of interaction between two JavaScript applications must
  have the following features:
    - two-way asynchronous data transfer with support of plentiful parallel
      non-blocking interactions and packet indentifiers allowing, for example,
      to find the correspondence between a request and a response;
    - support of RPC and multiple APIs must be so transparent that application
      shouldn't event know whether a function call is inside the address space
      of the application or it is a remote call sent to another system for
      execution;
    - direct call and response via callback support;
    - support of translation of named events with bound data and named channels
      for event grouping;
    - support of automatic synchronization of objects in applications memory
      if they are registered for synchronization;
    - only one of sides can initiate a connection but both sides can send data
      over open channel;
    - the transport layer must guarantee reliable data transfer with connection
      establishment and guaranteed delivery (TCP is the basic transport and we
      also support WebSocket but anything can be used, even RS232 or USB);
    - all packet types (call, response, callback, event, data etc.) may be split
      into several parts if their body is too large;
    - there should be a possibility to stop data transfer if the data
      transmitted in parts is too large and the last part hasn't been
      received yet;

* it is required to minimize the transformation of data while tranferring them
  between different systems, storing and processing, minimize putting them from
  one structures to other, to save memory and connection channel;

* amount of data structures needed for most systems is in fact finite and the
  structures themselves must be standardized as a result of specialists
  agreement, and there should be possibility of their versioning;

* non-standard data structures can be sent between systems along with metadata
  that will allow to interprete them and provide universal processing to the
  possible extent if the remote sides trust each other and formalization of
  data doesn't make sense.
